# Robot-waiter
Web controlled Robot-waiter with Turtlebot3 using ROS, Rviz and Gazebo simulator 	


This project is about simulating a robot that serves drinks to tables in a coffee shop
or a bar. For that purpose, I used a Turtlebot3 (Burger) robot.
I achieved this by doing several things:<br/><br/>
Properly configured the ROS navigation stack in the robot in order to make the robot
create a map of the environment.<br/>
Configured the ROS navigation stack to make the robot localize and navigate in the
environment, making use of the previously generated map. <br/>
Created a ROS program that allows to receive the number of a table through a topic,
that would be the table that has requested a drink.<br/>
Then, once the bartender published the table number in the topic using the webpage, the robot would go to that table and wait for
other commands, normally itâ€™s going to be to the barstand or it can be to any other table.
