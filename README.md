# Robot-waiter
Web controlled Robot-waiter with Turtlebot3 using ROS, Rviz and Gazebo simulator 	


This project is about simulating a robot that serves drinks to the tables in a coffee shop
or a bar. For that purpose, we are going to use a Turtlebot3 (Burger) robot.
We are going to achieve this by doing several things:<br/><br/>
Properly configure the ROS navigation stack in the robot in order to make the robot
create a map of the environment.<br/>
Configure the ROS navigation stack to make the robot localize and navigate in the
environment, making use of the previously generated map. <br/>
Create a ROS program that allows to receive the number of a table through a topic,
that would be the table that has requested a drink.<br/>
Then, once the bartender published the number in the topic using the webpage, the robot must go to that table and wait for
other commands, normally itâ€™s gonna be to the bar stand ot it can be to any other table.
